Major league hacking covid fighter game

Covid Defender is game developed as a Java Applet, where the player plays a role where they use a vaccine to destroy invading Covid-19 viruses. The game takes input from the players keyboard, allowing for the vaccine to have horizontal movement, while simultaneously shooting the cure at the disease. As most are currently at home during quarantine, Covid Defender allows for the opportunity to escape the boredom of the lockdown and have fun while also having a light-hearted theme that incorporates the virus.
